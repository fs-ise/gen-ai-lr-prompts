**Preparation**: Extract abstracts locally and provide them with the prompt.

**Prompt**

```Markdown
Context: I am screening papers for a systematic literature review.
The topic of the systematic review is [add topic here].
The study should focus exclusively on this topic.
Instruction: Decide if the article should be included or excluded
from the systematic review. I give the title and abstract of the
article as input. Only answer include or exclude. Be lenient.
I prefer including papers by mistake rather than excluding them by mistake.

Task i:

- Title: “Twelve tips to leverage AI for efficient and effective medical question generation”
- Abstract: “Crafting quality assessment questions in medical education […]”
```

**Preparation**: Use GROBID to convert PDF documents to TEI format and provide the TEI (xml) files as an input to the LLM.

**Prompt**

```Markdown
Read each xml document, which has the namespace http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0.
Extract the following items:
    • title, which is in TEI/teiHeader/fileDesc/titelStmt/title (display in title case)
    • abstract, which is in TEI/teiHeader/profileDesc/abstract/div (using all p tags)
    • keywords, which are in TEI/teiHeader/profileDesc/textClass/keywords
Translate the abstract to English (if necessary).
Arrange all results in a Markdown table. Add a “screening” column.
