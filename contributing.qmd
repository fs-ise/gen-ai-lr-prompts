## Guidelines

**Prompts**  
- Prompts reported in published and peer-reviewed papers only.  
- If a prompt has been used in practice (e.g., to assist in specific review tasks), briefly describe the use case and its outcomes.  
- Indicate any limitations or specific requirements for the prompt to work effectively (e.g., tools needed, data formats).
- Prompts from influential preprints may also be considered, provided their effectiveness has been clearly demonstrated.
- Contributions should include information on how the prompt was evaluated (e.g., in academic papers, systematic reviews, or practical use cases).  
- If applicable, include links to resources showcasing the evaluation process or results.

## Adding a New Prompt

If you would like to add a new prompt, follow these steps:  

1. Click the [edit button](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/gen-ai-lr-prompts/edit/main/README.md).  
2. Add your contribution in Markdown format under the appropriate section. Include:  
   - The intended use case (e.g., summarization, Boolean query generation).  
   - The prompt text.  
   - An example output as a quote.
   - A reference with a brief description of its application and evaluation.  
3. Use the "Preview changes" tab to ensure your contribution is formatted correctly.  
4. Provide a name for your proposed change and an optional description. Indicate that you would like to "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request," then click "Propose file change."
