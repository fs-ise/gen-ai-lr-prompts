## Guidelines


- Prompts reported in published and peer-reviewed papers only.  
- Prompts from influential preprints may also be considered, provided their effectiveness has been clearly demonstrated.  
- If a prompt has been used in practice (e.g., to assist in specific review tasks), briefly describe the use case and its outcomes.  
- Indicate any limitations or specific requirements for the prompt to work effectively (e.g., tools needed, data formats).  
- Contributions should include information on how the prompt was evaluated (e.g., in academic papers, systematic reviews, or practical use cases).  
- If applicable, include links to resources showcasing the evaluation process or results.

## Adding a New Prompt

If you would like to add a new prompt, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the page displaying related prompts (e.g., for the [search](search.html)).
1. Click the **Edit this page** button.  
2. Add your contribution in Markdown format. Include:
   - The intended use case (e.g., summarization, Boolean query generation).
   - The prompt text.
   - An example output (where feasible).
   - A reference to the academic paper evaluating the prompt to the `assets/references.bib`.
   - Add a link to the reference (e.g., `@SyrianiEtAl2024`) brief description of its application and evaluation.
3. Use the **Preview changes** tab to ensure your contribution is formatted correctly.
4. Provide a short name and (optionally) a description for your proposed change.
5. Select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**, then click **Propose file change**.

## Prompt Template

Each prompt should be documented using the following structure.
The example below illustrates the expected level of detail and formatting.

~~~Markdown

### [Short descriptive title of the prompt]

|                        |                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **GenAI capability**   | [e.g., Content generation, Data extraction, Analysis] |
| **Prompting strategy** | [e.g., Few-shot prompting, Exploratory prompting]     |
| **Requirements**       | [e.g., LLMs, file upload, large context window]       |
| **Academic study**     | [Citation]                                            |
:  {tbl-colwidths="[30,70]"}

**Prompt**

```Markdown
[Full prompt text as used with the LLM.
Write the prompt exactly as it should be executed,
including role framing, task description, and any
examples or constraints.]
```

**Example output**
*(Include where feasible; omit if not meaningful for the prompt type.)*

> [Representative excerpt of the model output, formatted as a quote.]

### Notes for contributors

- Use clear, descriptive titles (e.g., “Suggest an initial search query”).
- Prompts should be self-contained and executable.
- Example outputs should be illustrative, not exhaustive.
- If no example output is provided, briefly explain why (in the pull request).
