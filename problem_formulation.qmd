Definition: A "qualitative systematic review" aims at collecting and
aggregating empirical evidence from primary studies to test a narrowly
defined hypothesis or model. It is suitable for established topics for
which the research questions are narrow and the focus is on qualitative
or quantitative empirical studies.
Assess a review project focusing on [add description here]. Would a
qualitative systematic review be a suitable review type? Provide reasons
related to the topic maturity, the scope of research questions, and the
nature of prior work.
